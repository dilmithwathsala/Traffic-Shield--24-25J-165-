#Evaluating automated traffic violation detection system for road safety improvement üö¶
(Project ID: 24-25J-165)

## Project Overview üö¶

The research, *Evaluating Automated Traffic Violation Detection System for Road Safety Improvement*, focuses on developing an innovative system to address the challenges of traditional traffic management. By integrating advanced technologies such as computer vision, machine learning, and automated reporting, the system automates the detection of traffic violations, including speeding, signal breaches, and illegal parking. It provides real-time data to law enforcement, ensuring prompt action and better regulation. This system aims to improve road safety, reduce congestion, and support data-driven urban planning by delivering a modern, efficient, and scalable solution to urban traffic management challenges.

## Research Problem ‚ùì

The growing number of vehicles and the limitations of traditional traffic management systems have made enforcing road safety increasingly complex. Manual methods for detecting and reporting traffic violations are inefficient, prone to human error, and unable to handle the scale of urban traffic. These inefficiencies lead to missed violations, delayed enforcement, and increased congestion caused by infractions like illegal parking and signal breaches. Furthermore, the lack of real-time data prevents authorities from responding promptly to violations and traffic issues. This highlights the need for an automated system that enhances accuracy, enforces regulations effectively, and improves overall road safety.

## Solution Overview ‚úî

To address the challenges of traditional traffic management systems, TrafficShield integrates advanced technologies to overcome the limitations of conventional methods and improve road safety.
*Automated Violation Detection*: Identifies traffic violations in real time using computer vision.
*Vehicle Identification*: Tracks offenders with license plate recognition.
*Real-time Reporting*: Shares violation data instantly with law enforcement.
*Data-driven Insights*: Analyzes traffic trends for better planning.
*Secure Data Management*: Safely stores violation records in a central¬†database.
